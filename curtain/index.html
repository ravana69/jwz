<H1>Arduino-Based Curtain Automation, Mk 2</H1>


<P> In 2012, I built a controller so that I can open and close my
curtain from the command line!  It worked ok for a while, but 
eventually I rebuilt it from scratch.  The description of the
first build is <A HREF="https://www.jwz.org/curtain/2012.html"><B>here</B></A>, or read on for the
description of Curtain Mk 2.

<P> So.

<P> My apartment has a 16' wide floor-to-ceiling window, and a
correspondingly-huge curtain.  I wanted to put the curtain under
software control so I could do things like, for example, have it
automatically open in the morning to help me get out of bed.

<P><H2> Things that didn't work. </H2>

<P> My first approach was to buy an <A
HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003YVJ472">Add-a-Motor Model
80 Drapery and Blind Controller</A>, as a starting point.  It looked
like this would do <I>most</I> of what I wanted: open and close the
curtain by pulling on the rope.  All that was left was a small
matter of hooking up ethernet to its toggle button, right?

<P> Well, it wasn't that simple; I ended up having to discard all
of its circuitry and re-use just its electric motor, gearbox and
mounting hardware.  Downsides of this approach were:

<OL>
 <LI> The motor is <I><B>REALLY REALLY LOUD</B></I>.

 <P> Since one of my goals for this project was to have my curtain
 automatically open in the morning so that the daylight <I>subtly</I>
 reminds me to get out of bed without an actual alarm going off, this
 is a problem, since the noise of the thing would often wake me up.

 <P> I somewhat mitigated that by putting the whole mess inside a
 larger box and lining the inside of it with
 <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103065326/http://www.amazon.com:80/Ballistic-SSSK-Speaker-Kit/dp/B004J1WFX6">
 Ballistic Sound Dampening sheets</A>, which is a
 dense-rubber-and-aluminum sticky sheet designed for layering inside
 your car door panel to prevent rattling when you have a ludicrously
 deafening sound system.  It helped, but not enough.

 </LI><LI> The gearbox is made of plastic gears, and is a piece of shit.

 <P> Once I got the thing working, it worked for a couple of years,
 but eventually it catastrophically self-destructed, stripping a
 gear and cracking its own case while torquing itself off the wall.

 <P> So I bought another one and replaced it, and that one stripped
 a gear the very next day.  Since they're almost $100, I wasn't about
 to keep buying a new one every couple of months.

 </LI><LI> The mechanism is timer-based.

 <P> That means that if for some reason, opening the curtain and
 closing the curtain don't take the same amount of time -- e.g., when
 the shitty plastic gears are slipping at random -- the curtain won't
 close all the way.

 </LI>
</OL>

<P> So, you know, I don't really recommend the Add-a-Motor.
Unfortunately there doesn't seem to be any comparable product on the
market that isn't an integrated curtain track that costs more than
$4,000 -- and can only be remote controlled using mysterious,
proprietary systems that mostly rely on IR.


<P><H2> Starting over. </H2>

<P> Still a-glow from the flawless victory of my recent
<A HREF="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/src/phonebooth/index2.html">
payphone conversion project</A> (making a note here: huge success)
I decided to start over from scratch.  The new plan went a little
something like this:

  Hall effect sensors</A> to determine when the curtain is at the
  left end or right end of the rail.
 </LI>
</OL>

<P> Hall effect sensors are those magnet detectors that you see on
door alarms. They trigger when a strong magnet is nearby, and with a
reasonably strong magnet, that means "within about an inch".
(Pro tip: you need 2, so buy 10.  Don't be like me.)

<P> The Adafruit Motor Shield and its software are really easy to use,
and support a variety of motors.  First I tried a stepper motor, but
it wasn't nearly strong enough; even when double-stepping it, I could
still stop it with one finger.  So I got the above Pololu electric
motor, with an internal metal gearbox, and it's... <I>almost</I>
strong enough.  It can open the curtain just fine, but when closing
it, it really struggles at the end (as the curtain gets bunched up
and harder to compress) and sometimes it stalls out.

<P> So I may switch to 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905063311/https://www.pololu.com/product/3258">this one</A> instead,
which has more torque, but sadly, is only about half as fast
(378:1, 14 RPM, 320oz-in, 1.1a stall).  With the current motor, it takes
about 90 seconds to open the curtain.  With the slower/stronger one,
that would be about two and a half minutes...

<P> I haven't found another motor that is both higher speed and
torque, and that has a stall current under 1.2a (which is what the
Motor Shield requires).

<P> Update: I took a chance on
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20150905125839/https://www.pololu.com/product/3233">this one</A>,
which has a too-high stall current
(33 RPM, 210oz-in, 2.1a stall) and it was working great -- for about
a month and a half until it stripped an internal gear.  Sigh.

<P> Also: huge thanks to <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20120112051721/http://adafruit.com/">Limor</A>
for advice on what parts to use!  I wouldn't have even known where to
begin shopping for motors or how to quantify my requirements
otherwise.  <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20120112051721/http://adafruit.com/">Adafruit</A> is an
awesome company and you should buy all your stuff there.


<P><H2> The hardware. </H2>

<P> I used an Arduino proto board to keep all of my connectors 
removable and in the same place: I attached an 8-pin header to
it and routed everything through it.  I also added a pair of
LEDs to it to make it easier to debug the positioning of sensors:
I needed to be able to see whether the sensor was triggering from
across the room, while I was standing on a ladder...

<P> So my Arduino pin usage looks like:

<OL START=2>
 <LI> LED 1;
 </LI><LI> LED 2;
 </LI><LI> <I>Unused: Ethernet Shield usurps it</I>;
 </LI><LI> Sensor 1;
 </LI><LI> Sensor 2;
 </LI><LI> Push button.
</LI></OL>

<P> <P> The LEDs are wired directly, so that leaves three sets of cables
that go into the header:

<OL START=1>
 <LI> Push-button A;
 </LI><LI> Push-button B;<P>
 </LI><LI> Motor A;
 </LI><LI> Motor B;<P>
 </LI><LI> Sensor power;
 </LI><LI> Sensor ground;
 </LI><LI> Sensor 1 detect;
 </LI><LI> Sensor 2 detect.
</LI></OL>

<P> The Hall effect sensors have three pins, but they can share power
and ground, so two sensors means four wires.  I just ran Cat5 behind
the curtain track, with a fork for the first sensor.

<P> To mount them, I cut up small pieces of proto-board, soldered
on the sensors and the wires, and then glopped a generous serving
of epoxy over it all, since I knew I was going to be twisting and
fussing with them a lot while mounting them, and I didn't want any
chance of one of the wires breaking off.  

<P> right now they're stuck to the ceiling with foam-tape, but
eventually I'll epoxy them in place, once I'm certain the positioning
is correct.

<P> One difficulty was actually finding a place to put them that
didn't interfere with the motion of the curtain.  Even though the
curtain hangs below the track on hooks, the fabric of the curtain
actually extends above the track, so zip-tying the cable to the
track's bolts was making it get caught up.  I ended up having to
drill new holes in the ceiling just to mount the cable.  Nothing
says good times like standing on a ladder and drilling into 
concrete above your head...

<P>

</DIV>

<P> Turning the wheel and pulling on the cord was another difficulty...

<P> The old Add-a-Motor had a track that the box slid on to, and a
set-pin to hold it in place, so you could adjust the tension on the
cord.  That was a reasonable system, so I decided to re-use that by
bolting my new motor contraption into the old box.  My first attempt
at that, of just screwing the new motor housing to the old plastic
box, brought us back to the same old problem: everything about the
Add-a-Motor is a plastic piece of shit.  So of course it flexed too
much and didn't work right.

<P> I then stripped away most of the plastic box and screwed some
small steel plates to it to stiffen it, then mounted the motor to
that.  That'll hold it...

<P> I also re-used the rubber gripper-wheel from the Add-a-Motor,
after sandwiching it between two new wheels, because why not.

<P> See that pipe strap holding the motor to the bracket?  Yeah, that
was a bad idea.  Don't do that.  On my first attempt at this, I
tightened down that strap too much, and one of the screw-heads <I>very
slightly</I> dented the motor casing.  You know what happens to
electric motors that have dents in them?  They no longer turn.  So
don't do that.



<P><H2> The software. </H2>

<P><DIV STYLE="float: right; width: 55%; margin: 0 0 1em 2em;">

</DIV>

<P> It's only a minor update of the software I wrote 
<A HREF="https://www.jwz.org/curtain/2012.html">last time</A>, updated to understand the two
sensors (giving it three possible states: open, closed and middle,
rather than the two states it had last time.)  Also some LED-blinking
niceties to represent the various states and error conditions.

<P> It listens for connections on an Ethernet port, and reacts
to commands like <B>OPEN</B>, <B>CLOSE</B> and <B>TOGGLE</B>
by turning the motor on and off until it sees the status of the
sensors change.  And as a safety feature, if the motor has been
running for more than a couple of minutes without a sensor being
triggered, it panics and stops the motor anyway.

<P> There is also a push-button on the side of the device that does
the same thing as the <B>TOGGLE</B> command, for those times when I
want to open or close the curtain without using the computer to do
it.

<P> The code is pretty straightforward, but if you're writing your own
command-line-driven server for an Arduino Ethernet, this might be a
good starting point.

<P>
<DIV CLASS="box">
 Arduino source:
<A HREF="https://www.jwz.org/curtain/curtain.ino"><TT>curtain.ino</TT></A>

<P> And here's a Perl script for talking to that server from the
command-line, so you can type things like "<TT><B>curtain&nbsp;open</B></TT>":

<P><H2> An aside about the Arduino Ethernet library and how it sucks. </H2>

<P> Can I just take a moment to say again how <I>completely absurd</I>
the Arduino DHCP situation is?  Let me enumerate its sins:

<P>
<OL>

 <LI> You have to <I>hardcode your MAC address into your source!</I>
 <B><I>SERIOUSLY?</I></B>  If I had multiple devices and I wanted
 them to function simultaneously, I would have to edit the source code
 for each one of them before deploying?  (And don't tell me it would
 break the bank to include 48 <I>bits</I> of NVRAM on the Ethernet
 board -- I'll pay the extra $0.001.)

 <P> I mean, how does anything work at all?  Honestly, even talking
 about this is <I>embarrassing.</I> I feel <I>bad</I> for the people
 who allowed this situation to exist. I feel like even discussing this
 is like pointing out someone's big honking booger, like, is this
 really necessary, and can we just <I>not?</I>

 </LI><LI><P> If the Ethernet shield is not plugged in, the software
 does not detect that, and <TT>Ethernet.begin()</TT> simply <I>hangs
 forever</I> and your device will not boot.  So have fun debugging
 the software in an ethernet-less test environment.

 </LI><LI><P> If the Ethernet <I>cable</I> is not plugged in,
 <TT>Ethernet.begin()</TT> stalls for <I>two minutes</I> waiting for a
 response. Because apparently link-detect is too hard.  And not only
 is that timeout unreasonably long, but there is no way to adjust it.

 </LI><LI><P> Should your device boot up with no DHCP lease... forget
 about it, you can't get one later either, unless you're willing to
 periodically risk that two minute timeout.

 </LI><LI><P> It will never renew your lease, ever.  So if your router
 decides to give your IP to someone else, because you've never renewed
 it... well, I guess you get to walk over there and power-cycle your
 device.

 </LI><LI><P> If you google around for a minute, you'll find some
 references to an "EthernetDHCP" library that purports to fix many of
 these problems -- Asynchronous operation! Configurable timeouts! 
 Actually <I>renewing leases!</I> This is like some Star Trek science
 fictional future crazy-talk here! -- but...

 <P> ...wait for it...

 <P> ...that software is from like <I>2013</I>, which was <I>three
 years ago</I>, so of course it no longer compiles, its features
 were never re-integrated back into the standard Ethernet library,
 and it now appears to be abandonware.

 </LI><LI> Oh yeah, and though it's not particularly Ethernet related,
 wow, the Mac Arduino.app really is a piece of shit.  I mean, it's
 written in Java, so complaining about how relentlessly terrible it is
 really feels like kicking a puppy. A puppy with no hind legs.  But
 wow is it bad.

 <P> It has innumerable failings, but it's greatest sin is not
 bothering to notice when the file loaded into it has changed on disk
 (because, say, you're using an external editor) and automatically
 re-reading it, like <I>every other IDE in the world does.</I> This is
 related to its second-greatest sin, which is that it <I>does not use
 standard Mac text-areas</I>, which means that the built-in editor
 does not implement Emacs keybindings, so editing code within the
 Arduino app is like dictating your code over the telephone.

 <P> But I digress.

</LI></OL>

<P>

<P><H2> Would you like to come up and see my automata? </H2>

<P> At this point there's a fair amount of home-brewed automation in
my apartment.  My receiver (a Denon X2000) has ethernet, so I wrote a
<A HREF="https://www.jwz.org/hacks/tuner">Perl script</A> to speak the
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20130831050740/http://usa.denon.com/US/Downloads/Pages/InstructionManual.aspx?FileName=DocumentMaster/US/AVR-3808CISerialProtocol_Ver5.2.0a.pdf">
AVR/AVC control protocol</a>.  This means I can change the
volume and input sources from the computer without getting out of
my chair: sweet!  (Some people might have used an IR remote control
for this. How pedestrian.)

<P> My current video projector (an 
<A HREF="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00GGGQHHC/"> Optoma
X600</A>) does not do anything sensibly straightforward like just have
a web server in it for remote control, but there <I>is</I> a
<TT>Net::PJLink</TT> Perl library that knows how to talk to it, so I
can power it on and off from the web.  Sweet.

<P> So, combine the two of these with a properly-configured
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20120103151030/http://store.griffintechnology.com:80/desktop/powermate">
Griffin PowerMate</A>, and I've got a big button sitting on my
desk that adjusts the volume when I turn it, and toggles the
projector on and off when I smack it.  Turning the projector
on also pauses iTunes and switches to the proper input on the
tuner; and turning it off does the reverse.
(Important: use the the PowerMate 2.1 software.  The 3.0
software totally shit the bed.)

<P> This is especially handy for those times when I fall asleep
watching TV, because when I wake up and stumble toward the bedroom,
I can hit the big button to turn off the projector without having
to wake up enough to focus my eyes on a remote!

<P> Turning on the projector also closes the curtain -- and, I have a
cron job that opens the curtain in the morning to remind me that
daylight exists.
