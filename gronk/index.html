<P> In late 1999, I converted all of my compact discs to MP3s files, and
<B>Gronk</B> is the quick-<WBR>and-<WBR>dirty software package I threw
together to maintain my collection and control the playlist.

Linux for MacOS and never looked back.  Now I just use
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20010124075100/http://www.apple.com:80/itunes/download/">iTunes</A>

<P><BR> At the time, I looked around at other Linux jukebox programs, and none of
them really did exactly what I wanted.  Either they had user interfaces that I
didn't like, or they were far too complicated to install.  Among other
things, they all seem to rely heavily on MySQL.  Sorry, but the fact is
that when you're only dealing with ten or twenty thousand items, a
database is overkill.  Especially since these items change infrequently
(how many CDs do you buy a week?)  So Gronk is built almost entirely
around static HTML pages: it goes through the MP3 files and the CDDB
data, and constructs HTML representing all of the discs.  When you add
a new set of CDs, regenerate the pages.  Even with my huge collection
this only takes a few minutes.

<H2><A NAME="wishlist">Wish List:</A></H2>

<strike>
<P><UL>

 <LI> The web UI should show the time remaining, and have a scrollbar
  for zipping around in the song, and for showing progress.

 </LI><LI> The UI for ``never play this song'' needs work.

 </LI><LI> Scoring would be interesting: instead of just excluding
  songs, being able to tell it to play certain songs more often.

 </LI><LI> Right now there is no mechanism for playing random other
  MP3 files, only ones that are already ``in the system.''

 </LI><LI> I think the presentation of the compilation albums (the
 ``Various'' pseudo-band) is kind of unwieldy.  There are just
 too many entries in that list.

 </LI><LI> I need better icons: the ``play'' icons are too reminiscent of
 outliner-expander triangles, so some people have thought that clicking
 on the triangle meant ``show me the tracks on this album'' rather than
 ``play this album.''

 </LI><LI> More direct support for

<H2><A NAME="requirements">Requirements:</A></H2>

<P><UL>

 <LI> Perl 5.

 <P></LI><LI> A whole lot of MP3 files, and their corresponding 
  <A HREF="#cddb">CDDB</A> files.

 <P></LI><LI> A web browser that supports HTML circa 1995.
  (Tables and colors, but no JavaScript, no layers, no plugins.)

 <P></LI><LI> A web server (anything that supports
  <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000229120240/http://www.apache.org:80/">Apache</A>-style
  ``<TT>.htaccess</TT>'' files and CGI scripts.)

 <P></LI><LI> <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20010506223651/http://ibiblio.org:80/mp3info/"><B>mp3info</B></A> or
         <A HREF="ftp://bimbo.hive.no/pub/mp3info/"><B>mp3info</B></A>.

 <P></LI><LI> <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000301101913/http://xmms.org:80/"><B>XMMS</B></A>,
  <B>mpg123</B>, or <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20011116090328/http://mpg321.sourceforge.net:80/"><B>mpg321</B></A>
  for playback.  I found that playback would skip with mpg123 (e.g.,
  while I am ripping CDs) but that XMMS doesn't skip, so that's what I
  use.  Also, with XMMS you get a scrollbar and a playback timer, which
  the web page doesn't include.

 <P></LI><LI> If you are using XMMS, you'll also need
  Doug MacEachern's Perl XMMS interface 
  <NOBR>(<TT>perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::Xmms'</TT>)</NOBR> which
  will in turn require the xmms and xmms-devel packages (from
  <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000301101913/http://xmms.org:80/">xmms.org</A>.)

</LI></UL>


<H2><A NAME="setup">My Setup:</A></H2>

<P><UL>

 <LI> I had a dedicated machine to serve as my jukebox.
  It was a Pentium III running Linux, with lots and lots of disk space.

 <P></LI><LI> I never sat in front of that machine, but it did have a monitor.
  It was running a browser showing the Gronk web page, from which I could
  walk over and adjust the playlist.  


 <P></LI><LI> It also ran <A HREF="https://www.jwz.org/xscreensaver/"><B>XScreenSaver</B></A>
  (of course!) and one of the utilities included with the Gronk package
  is a program that will periodically pop up a window showing the name
  of the currently-playing song in multi-inch-high letters, so that one
  can read it from across the room.  This only pops up while the 
  screen saver is on.

 <P></LI><LI> And most importantly, since it is a stereo component, I
  spraypainted it black.

 <P></LI><LI> I ripped my CDs using
  <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000816002154/http://www.nostatic.org:80/grip/"><B>Grip</B></A>,
  <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19991006105044/http://www.xiph.org:80/paranoia/"><B>CD Paranoia</B></A>, and
  <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20001110133800/http://www.mp3dev.org:80/mp3/"><B>LAME</B></A>.
  But you can use whatever you like, so long as you follow the same
  file naming convention, and have the CDDB files available
  (see <A HREF="#cddb">below</A>.)

  <P></LI><LI> I generally just listen to everything on random shuffle.
   That plus the "Never Play This Song Again" button works out pretty
   nicely...

</LI></UL>


<H2><A NAME="tips">Rip Tips:</A></H2>

<P><UL>

<P> Gronk is picky about the naming conventions used by the MP3 files.
Basically, there should be a directory for each band; and within those,
a directory for each album; and within those, an MP3 file for each
song.  The MP3 files should be named
``<B><I>nn</I>-<I>song</I>.mp3</B>'' where <TT><B><I>nn</I></B></TT> is
the track number.  The song name (and the names of the band/album
directories) should be lower case, with spaces converted to
underscores, and all non-alphanumeric chars deleted.

<P> If you use <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000816002154/http://www.nostatic.org:80/grip/"><B>Grip</B></A>
to rip your CDs, use these settings in its preferences:

<P><UL>
<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=0 CELLSPACING=0>
<TR><TD NOWRAP>Rip File Format: </TD><TD><TT>~/mp3/%A/%d/%t-%n.wav</TT></TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD NOWRAP>MP3 File Format: </TD><TD><TT>~/mp3/%A/%d/%t-%n.mp3</TT></TD>
</TR></TABLE>
</UL>

<P> <B><I>WARNING!</I></B> Make sure you use <B>%A</B> and not
<B>%a</B>, or Grip will do horrible things with compilation albums.

</UL>

<H2><A NAME="cddb">CDDB Files:</A></H2>

<UL>

<P> Gronk is very much ``disc'' based: it is organized with the
assumption that you have a large collection of complete CDs ripped,
not a scattered collection of single-track MP3 files.  It expects
a directory per CD, containing all/only the tracks from that CD.

<P> Gronk needs access to the CDDB files that correspond to the ripped
CDs.  It doesn't care about ID3 tags at all.  This is because ID3
imposes 30-character limits on field lengths, whereas the FreeDB/CDDB
data can be arbitrarily long, contains more information, is
centralized, and is generally more accurate.  If you have ripped the
CDs yourself (or even if you have ever played them on your computer)
then the CDDB files will be sitting in your <TT>~/.cddb/</TT>
directory.

<P> If you did not rip the CDs yourselves, you can probably find
the CDDB files by searching on <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000304141002/http://freedb.org:80/">
<B>freedb.org</B></A>.  Or, you can try and generate a ``close enough''
CDDB file from the MP3 files you have using the included
<TT>make-cddb.pl</TT> script (see the <TT>README</TT> for details.)

</UL>


<A NAME="changelog"><H2>Changelog:</H2></A>

<UL>

<H2> New in 1.9:</H2>

<P><UL>

  <LI> ID3 tags are written with "id3tag" instead of "mp3info",
  which means that both ID3v1 and ID3v2 tags will be used now.

  </LI><LI> make-cddb.pl understands ID3v2, meaning it will do
  a better job of importing MP3s ripped with iTunes.

  </LI><LI> mp3ify.sh will convert .m4a to .mp3 with "faad".

</LI></UL>

<H2> New in 1.8:</H2>

<P><UL>

  <LI> Regenerating the HTML tree is faster.

  </LI><LI> The splash page says how many albums, tracks, and total playing
  time exist in the archive.

  </LI><LI> No HTML files or links are modified unless that modification
  would change something.

  </LI><LI> Likewise, cddb2mp3.pl does not alter an MP3 file unless
  there would have been a change to the contents of the file's ID3 tag.

  </LI><LI> When MP3 files have Gronk-incompatible names, it notices
  that and suggests likely renamings.

  </LI><LI> make-cddb.pl (the script that constructs a .cddb file from
  a directory of existing MP3 files) is much smarter now: it looks at
  both file names and ID3 tags.

  </LI><LI> All pages have a charset tag now, to counteract
  recently-stupidified Apache defaults.

</LI></UL>

<H2> New in 1.7:</H2>

<P><UL>

  <LI> There are mouse-overs describing the functions of the buttons.

  </LI><LI> The playlists have a "kill this song" button which gives the
  current song a score of -1 (so it won't be auto-selected again.)

</LI></UL>

<H2> New in 1.6:</H2>

<P><UL>

  <LI> Handle multiple album-cover images.

  </LI><LI> Corrected computation of the length of data tracks.

  </LI><LI> If there is a subdirectory called <TT>data</TT>, assume that is
  the contents of the CDROM portion of the CD, and link the listing 
  entry for the "data track" to it.

  </LI><LI> Added a <I>"Lots More Songs"</I> link (adds 20 tracks, as
  opposed to <I>"More Songs"</I> which adds 5.)

  </LI><LI> More Perl broken-unicode workarounds.

</LI></UL>

<H2> New in 1.5:</H2>

<P><UL>

  <LI> Speed improvements: you will really notice the difference if
  your playlog file has gotten really big!

  </LI><LI> Added support for album cover images (<I>band/album/</I>cover.jpg)

  </LI><LI> Added support for generation of an "index directory": a tree of
  files that look just like the Gronk control files, but contain links
  directly to the .mp3 files instead of to the playlist-controlling
  CGIs.  This is just a way to make a directory full of MP3 files look
  pretty, by having CDDB-derived HTML listing it.

  </LI><LI> Improved some error messages.

  </LI><LI> xsplash takes -geometry and -placement args now.

</LI></UL>


<H2> New in 1.4:</H2>

<P><UL>
  <LI> Minor HTML tweaks to make it not look like hell in Mozilla.
  </LI><LI> Changed <TT>freedb-submit.pl</TT> to force people to change
   the default email address and stop submitting things as me.
</LI></UL>


<H2> New in 1.3:</H2>

<P><UL>
  <LI> Moved all run-time-written files to a `<TT>DATA</TT>' subdirectory
       instead of leaving them in the source directory.
  </LI><LI> Added support for Apache's setuid tricks.
  </LI><LI> Made it work with
       <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20010506223651/http://ibiblio.org:80/mp3info/">either</A>
       <A HREF="ftp://bimbo.hive.no/pub/mp3info/">version</A>
       of the
       <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20001211050500/http://freshmeat.net:80/projects/mp3info"><B>mp3info</B></A>
       program.
  </LI><LI> Added a `Pause' button.
  </LI><LI> Various cleanups and minor fixes.
  <P> 
       Many thanks to Alan Eldridge &lt;alane@geeksrus.net&gt; for
       his contributions to this release.
</LI></UL>


<H2> New in 1.2:</H2>

<P><UL>
  <LI> Support for <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000304141002/http://freedb.org:80/">FreeDB</A>
       protocol level 5.
  </LI><LI> Various minor fixes.
</LI></UL>


<H2> New in 1.1:</H2>

<P><UL>
  <LI> Some minor code cleanup (perl de-squicking.)
  </LI><LI> Pages for an artist also include links to tribute albums
       (compilations of covers of that artist's songs.)
  </LI><LI> Made Gronk refuse to queue a song if it is already on the 
       playlist (to avoid accidental multi-clicks.)
  </LI><LI> The search form also lets you list recent additions within
       the last <I>N</I> hours or days.
  </LI><LI> A page is generated that lists bands who appear <I>only</I>
       on compilation albums.
  </LI><LI> When generating HTML pages, some trivial spelling mismatches
       will be flagged (e.g., ``Foo &amp; Bar'' versus ``Foo and Bar''.)

</LI></UL>


<H2> New in 1.0:</H2>

<P><UL>
  <LI> Who am I kidding with this version number nonsense.  
       Let's call it 1.0 now.
  </LI><LI> Changed the diagnostic output of build-pages.pl to be more
       brief and readable, so that the error messages don't just
       scroll away.
  </LI><LI> When the playlist is long, it will also display the cumulative
       duration of the songs (useful for when you're trying to queue
       up at least <I>N</I> hours of music for a party...)
  </LI><LI> When generating HTML pages, dim out songs that have low scores.
  </LI><LI> Various minor bug fixes.

</LI></UL>


<H2> New in 0.7:</H2>

<P><UL>
  <LI> Added ``More Songs'' and ``Shuffle Playlist'' commands.
  </LI><LI> Made it possible to disable the ``play whole album'' button,
        since people tend to hit that by accident a lot, and it's
        a pain to clean up after...
  </LI><LI> Made a score of -3 mean ``don't play this song even if 
        someone is foolish enough to request it explicitly.''
  </LI><LI> Various other minor bug fixes and stability improvements.

</LI></UL>

<H2> New in 0.6:</H2>

<P><UL>
  <LI> Added a script for generating fake-but-plausible CDDB data
        given a set of MP3 files.
  </LI><LI> The display of compilation albums has changed: now there is
        a secondary frameset, so that it's easier to scroll through
        a huge list of comps.
  </LI><LI> The ``recently played'' page now shows whether the songs were
        random, or requests.

</LI></UL>

<H2> New in 0.5:</H2>

<P><UL>
  <LI> There is now a search form, that lets you do regexp searches
   though all song names, band names, and album titles.
  </LI><LI> There is a link that shows you songs that were recently played,
   in addition to upcoming songs.
  </LI><LI> A couple of minor bug fixes.

</LI></UL>

<H2> New in 0.4:</H2>

<P><UL>
  <LI> There is another column of icons in the playlist, allowing you
   to move an indicated song to the top or bottom of the list;

  </LI><LI> When you explicitly add a song to the playlist, it is added
   after any other explicitly-<WBR>added songs, but before any
   randomly-<WBR>selected songs that might already be present.

  </LI><LI> When songs are being randomly chosen, it won't choose a song if
   it has already been played recently, or if another song by that
   band has been played recently (both of these thresholds are 
   tweakable.)

</LI></UL>
