<H1>about:jwz</H1>

 <P><BR>

Hi, I'm Jamie Zawinski.  I'm the proprietor of
<A HREF="https://www.dnalounge.com/">DNA Lounge</A>, a world famous and
<A HREF="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/press/">award-winning</A>
all ages dance club and live music venue in San Francisco, and of
<A HREF="http://www.dnapizza.com/">DNA Pizza</A>, our attached cafe
and pizzeria.

<P> Prior to that, I worked as a programmer.  I was one of the
founders of <A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/">Netscape</A> and
<A HREF="https://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla.org</A>, and have been
involved in the free software and open source community since the
mid-80s.  I was the primary developer of Lucid Emacs (now
<A HREF="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</A>), and probably wrote most
of your 
<A HREF="xscreensaver/index.html">screen savers</A>.

<P> I have a <A HREF="blog/index.html">blog</A>.  It's pretty popular.

<P> To contact me, <A HREF="contact.html">send me mail</A>.

<DL>
 <DT>1985</DT>
 <DD> While I was still in high school, I wheedled my way into a
  part-time programming job at
  <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111202140739/http://www.cs.cmu.edu/">Carnegie-Mellon University</A>
  working for
  <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111124200005/http://www.cs.cmu.edu:80/~sef/">Scott Fahlman</A> on the
 <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111126114145/http://www.cons.org:80/cmucl/">Spice Lisp project</A>.
 </DD>

 <DT>1986</DT>
 <DD> After high school, I went to work for a small startup called
 Expert Technologies, writing a Lisp Machine-based expert system to do
 pagination and layout.
 </DD>

 <DT>1989</DT>
 <DD> I left the Blighted East to work at
 <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111126205927/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu:80/">UC Berkeley</a> for
 <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111202051913/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu:80/Faculty/Homepages/wilensky.html/">
 Robert Wilensky</A> and

 <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111130024639/http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu:80/Research/Areas/AI/">BAIR</A> group,
 doing more Lisp Machine-based AI work on natural language processing.
 </DD>
</DL>

<H1 CLASS="head">Chapter Two: I Am Nailed to the Hull</H1>

<DL>
 <DT>1990</DT>
 <DD> I began working at
  <A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucid_Inc.">Lucid Inc.</A>,
  porting 
  <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20120101213804/http://www.lispworks.com:80/products/lcl.html">Lucid Common Lisp</A>
  to new machines.
 </DD>

 <DT>1991</DT>
 <DD> I was the primary developer of
  <A HREF="doc/lemacs.html">Lucid Emacs</A>, the first variant
  of <A HREF="doc/emacs-timeline.html">GNU Emacs</a> with a real
  GUI and modern desktop integration.  It eventually became
  <A HREF="http://www.xemacs.org/">XEmacs</A>.
 </DD>

 <DT>1992</DT>
 <DD> I released <A HREF="xscreensaver/index.html">XScreenSaver</A> on an
  unsuspecting world.
 </DD>

 <DT>1994</DT>
 <DD> I was one of the initial employees of 
 <A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/">Mosaic Communications
 Corporation</A>, later known as 
 <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19961110090508/https://www.netscape.com/">Netscape</A>.  I was responsible
 for the Unix versions of <A HREF="http://home.mcom.com/archives/">
 Netscape Navigator</A> through release 1.1.  I came up with
 the name 
 <A HREF="blog/2016/10/they-live-and-the-secret-history-of-the-mozilla-logo/index.html">"Mozilla"</A>.  I also started "blogging" that year, though
 that word hadn't been invented yet.
 </DD>

 <DT>1995</DT>
 <DD> I designed, and <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111205204733/http://www.weissman.org:80/">Terry Weissman</A>
 and I implemented, the Netscape Mail and News clients, versions 2.0
 through 3.0.  HTML email is 
 <A HREF="blog/2017/09/html-email-was-that-your-fault/index.html">
 probably my fault.</A>
 </DD>

 <DT>1996</DT>
 <DD> I worked with
      <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111211040655/http://www.repbot.org:80/lisa/">Lisa Repka</A> on
      <A HREF="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S/MIME">
      S/MIME</A> in an attempt to keep everyone's email encrypted
      and secure from the prying eyes of the government and other
      snoops.  That didn't really work out.
 </DD>

 <DT>1997</DT>
 <DD> <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111205204733/http://www.weissman.org:80/">Terry</A>,
      <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20071223055316/http://www.meer.net:80/~scullin/">Will Scullin</A> and
      I re-wrote Netscape Mail in Java, as
      <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19981201194338/http://www.mozilla.org/projects/grendel/">Grendel</A>.
      That didn't really work out either.
 </DD>

 <DT>1998</DT>
 <DD> I was the accidental impetus for Netscape's decision to release
  the browser source code, and I was one of the creators and curators
  of the <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111130144728/http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla Organization</A>
  during the first year of its life.  We coordinated the
  <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20111201033101/http://www.opensource.org:80/">open source</A> development
  of the browser, which eventually became Firefox.
 </DD>

 <DD> I've written a lot of other software, too.  You can find it all
 on my <A HREF="hacks/index.html">hacks</A> page.  I've also done a bit of
 writing <I>about</I> software, which is on <A HREF="doc/index.html">doc</A>.

<H1 CLASS="head">Chapter Three: I Am Eaten by Sharks</H1>

<DL>
 <DT>1999</DT>
 <DD> I purchased the <A HREF="https://www.dnalounge.com/">DNA Lounge</A>
  nightclub in San Francisco, which had first opened in 
  <A HREF="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/1906-1998.html">1985</A>.
  The City of San Francisco was determined to shut the club down permanently
  rather than allow me to revitalize it, and so many legal battles ensued,
  followed by a year-long remodeling project.
  All of this is documented in excruciating detail in my
  <A HREF="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2000/03/">
  DNA Lounge blog</A>.

 </DD>
  
 <DT>2001</DT>
 <DD> DNA Lounge re-opened on Friday the 13th, July 2001.
 And there was much rejoicing.  
 </DD>

 <DT>2008</DT>
 <DD> After another multi-year legal battle, I managed to convert
  DNA Lounge from a 21+ venue to an
  <A HREF="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2008/08/18.html">
  all-ages venue</A>.
 </DD>

 <DT>2010</DT>
 <DD> In honor of DNA Lounge's 25th anniversary, The San Francisco Board
  of Supervisors and Mayor Gavin Newsom declared
  <A HREF="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2010/11/22.html">
  November 22nd to be DNA Lounge Day.</A>
 </DD>

 <DT>2011</DT>
 <DD> I purchased the restaurant next door to DNA Lounge and
  converted it to a 24-hour cafe and pizza restaurant,
  <A HREF="http://www.dnapizza.com/">DNA Pizza</A>.
 </DD>

 <DT>2015</DT>
 <DD> I opened a new nightclub,
 <A HREF="http://www.codeword-sf.com/">Codeword</A>, plus a second
  location of <A HREF="http://www.dnapizza.com/">DNA Pizza</A> at
  917 Folsom Street (the former Covered Wagon Saloon).
  That lasted through 2017.
 </DD>
</DL>

 <DT>2016</DT>
 <DD> DNA Lounge began a <A HREF="https://www.patreon.com/dnalounge">
 membership program</A> on Patreon.
 </DD>
</DL>

 <DT>2017</DT>
 <DD> The San Francisco Board of Supervisors classified DNA Lounge as a
  <A HREF="https://www.dnalounge.com/backstage/log/2017/12/11.html">
  Legacy Business</A>, a program to support long-term small businesses that
  contribute to the city's unique culture in the face of massive and growing
  gentrification and economic disparity.
