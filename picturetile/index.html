This program takes a bunch of images and randomly tiles them into one
large image.  The images need not be of the same size or aspect ratio.
Images are chosen randomly, and no image will be used more than once.

<P> Back when I used a film camera, I used to cover one of my walls
with snapshots, but now that I use a digital camera, I no longer have
prints lying around.  I wrote this program to make it easy to cover my
wall with digital prints in the form of large posters.

<P> The image to the right is an example of the kind of layout it can
do: note that the source images are of a variety of sizes and shapes.

 See the comments at the top of the script for descriptions of the
 various command-line options.  It's fairly straightforward, but
 some arithmetic is required.

<P> To print out my posters, I first picked around 300 of my favorite
photos from the last several years, and copied them into one place.
Then, I did this:

<A HREF="https://www.jwz.org/picturetile/picturetile2.jpg"><IMG
 SRC="https://www.jwz.org/picturetile/picturetile2b.jpg" 
 STYLE="float: right; width: 50%; max-width: 250px; max-height: 183px;
   border: 1px solid;"></A>
<I><FONT SIZE="-1">The end result!</FONT></I>

<P>
<PRE STYLE="font-size: 8pt">
 picturetile.pl -v         \
    --size 12900x25200     \
    --directory <I>my-photos</I>  \
    --scale 0.4882         \
    --margin 37            \
    --border 75            \
    --pages 2              \
    out.tiff
</PRE>

<P> That gave me two output files, <B>out1.tiff</B> and
<B>out2.tiff</B>, each of which was 490&nbsp;MB and measured
3&frac12;'&nbsp;&times;&nbsp;7' at 300 DPI.  These files were composed
of roughly 5&quot; photos, with an overall &frac14;&quot; border
around the whole image.  Each sheet ended up with roughly 150 pictures
on it (that's why I started with 300 pictures.)

<P> As it happens, I have a friend who has access to a
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20050811085642/http://www.epson.com:80/cgi-bin/Store/WideFormat/WideFormatDetail.jsp?BV_UseBVCookie=yes&amp;oid=-12982&amp;category=">printer</A>
that can print on paper that big!  For those of you who don't have
friends with access to such great toys at work, you'll have to take
your files to Kinko's or similar to get them printed.

<P> Mounting them to the wall was the next challenge, for two reasons:
first, my walls are concrete; and second, it's a lot of paper: giant
posters like this are pretty heavy!  What I ended up doing was getting
two huge sheets of foam-core at a local art-supply store, mounting
those to the wall with double-sided sticky tape, and then mounting the
prints to the foam-core.  Initially I planned to use thumb tacks, but
that didn't work out, so I ended up using the sticky tape to mount the
prints to the foam-core.  I could have mounted the prints directly to
the wall, but this way it will be possible (but not easy!) to move
them without destroying them.

<BR CLEAR=BOTH>
