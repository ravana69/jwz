Greetings, people of the future!

<P> This piece has gotten a lot of attention over the years.  I have
heard a lot of people saying that they had been "inspired" by it.  I
fear that what they meant was that they were inspired by the one
pull-quote that people tend to quote from it, and ignored the rest.
So if someone has linked you to this page, or if you've googled that
pull-quote and ended up here, let me give you some context.  I wrote
this in 2005, which was more than a year before Facebook was open
to the general public.

<P> The world was different then.

<P> When I hear people say that they were "inspired" by this, I fear
that the result of such inspiration was most likely to cause them to
participate in the construction of the Public-Private Surveillance
Partnership.  These people told themselves that they were building
tools to "bring people together" when in fact what they were doing was
constructing and enabling the information-broker business models used
by companies like Facebook and Equifax, where people are not the
customers but rather are the raw materials whose <i>personal
details</i> are the product.

<P> I was talking about decentralization and empowerment of the
individual.  They went and build the exact opposite.

<P> It's not a great feeling to think that someone may have read your
words and then gone on to construct the dystopian hellscape that we're
now living in, where Twitter is the prime enabler of <I>actual
Nazis</I> and Facebook's greatest accomplishment has been to put a
racist rapist in the White House.

<P> If all the people who claimed to have been "inspired" by this
piece hadn't been, and had just kept writing middleware for banks or
whatever, the world might have been a slightly better place.

<P> I wish I had never published this.

<P> Today <A HREF="http://www.nat.org/2005/february/#15-February-2005">
Nat announced</A> this new calendar server project called
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20070405234952/http://www.hula-project.org:80/">Hula</A>, and I've got a funny
story about that.

<P> Nat was in town, and he stopped by to say hi and chat, and he
said, "So we've got this big pile of code we're going to release, and
we're going to build an open source groupware system! It's going to be
awesome!"

<P> And I said, "Jesus Mother of Fuck, what are you thinking! Do not
strap the 'Groupware' albatross around your neck! That's what killed
Netscape, are you insane?" He looked at me like I'd just kicked his
puppy.

<P><B>Groupware BAD</B>

<P><UL>

  <P> See, there were essentially two things that killed Netscape (and
  the real answer is book length, so I'm simplifying greatly, but)

  <P><OL>

    <LI> The one that got most of the press was Microsoft's illegal
    use of their monopoly in one market (operating systems) to destroy
    an existing market (web browsers) by driving the market price for
    browsers to zero, instantaneously eliminating something like 60%
    of Netscape's revenue. Which was, you know, bad.

    <P></LI><LI> But the other one is that Netscape 4 was a really
    crappy product. We had built this really nice entry-level mail
    reader in Netscape 2.0, and it was a smashing success. Our
    punishment for that success was that management saw this
    general-purpose mail reader and said, "since this mail reader is
    popular with normal people, we must now pimp it out to `The
    Enterprise', call it Groupware, and try to compete with Lotus
    Notes!"

    <P> To do this, they bought a company called Collabra who had
    tried (and, mostly, failed) to do something similar to what we had
    accomplished. They bought this company and spliced 4 layers of
    management in above us. Somehow, Collabra managed to completely
    take control of Netscape: it was like Netscape had gotten acquired
    instead of the other way around.

    <P> And then they went off into the weeds so badly that the
    Collabra-driven "3.0" release was obviously going to be so
    mind-blowingly late that "2.1" became "3.0" and "3.0" became
    "4.0". (So yeah, 3.0 didn't just <I>seem</I> like the bugfix
    patch-release for 2.0: it <I>was.</I>)

    </LI>
 </OL>

  <P> Now the problem here is that the product's direction changed
  utterly. Our focus in the client group had always been to build
  products and features that <I>people</I> wanted to use. That
  <I>we</I> wanted to use. That our <I>moms</I> wanted to use.

  <P> "Groupware" is all about things like "workflow", which means,
  "the chairman of the committee has emailed me this checklist, and
  I'm done with item 3, so I want to check off item 3, so this
  document must be sent back to my supervisor to approve the fact that
  item 3 is changing from `unchecked' to `checked', and once he does
  that, it can be directed back to committee for review."

  <P> Nobody cares about that shit. Nobody you'd want to talk to,
  anyway. 

</UL>
<P><B>Users GOOD</B>
<P><UL>

  <P> If you want to do something that's going to change the world,
  build software that <I>people want to use</I> instead of software
  that <I>managers want to buy.</I>

  <P> When words like "groupware" and "enterprise" start getting
  tossed around, you're doing the latter. You start adding features to
  satisfy line-items on some checklist that was constructed by
  interminable committee meetings among bureaucrats, and you're coding
  toward an externally-dictated product specification that maybe some
  company will want to buy a hundred "seats" of, but that nobody will
  ever <I>love.</I> With that kind of motivation, nobody will ever
  find it <I>sexy.</I> It won't make anyone <I>happy.</I>

  <P> Ok, I said it was a funny story, but obviously that's not the
  funny part, unless sad is funny.

  <P> Anyway, I babbled at Nat along these lines for a while,
  predicting that, while I was sure that anyone he talked to in a
  corporation would tell him, "free groupware, yes, awesome!", there
  was really no reason to even bother releasing something like that as
  open source, because there was going to be absolutely no buy-in from
  the "itch-scratching" crowd. With a product like that, there was
  going to be no teenager in his basement hacking on it just because
  it was cool, or because it doing so made his life easier. Maybe IBM
  would throw some bucks at a developer or two to help out with it,
  because it might be cheaper to pay someone to write software than to
  just buy it off the shelf. But with a groupware product, nobody
  would ever work on it unless they were getting paid to, because it's
  just fundamentally not interesting to <i>individuals.</I>

  <P> So I said, narrow the focus. Your "use case" should be, there's
  a 22 year old college student living in the dorms. How will this
  software get him laid?

  <P> That got me a look like I had just sprouted a third head, but
  bear with me, because I think that it's not only crude but
  insightful. "How will this software get my users laid" should be on
  the minds of anyone writing social software (and these days, almost
  all software is social software).

  <P> "Social software" is about making it easy for people to do other
  things that make them happy: meeting, communicating, and hooking
  up.

</UL>
<P><B>Calendars USEFUL</B>
<P><UL>

  <P> I said, instead of trying to build some all-singing all-dancing
  "collaboration server" where you're going to throw in all kinds of
  ridiculous line items like bulletin boards and task tracking and
  other shit, let's suppose you narrow your focus to just calendars.

  <P> The first thing you want to do is make it trivially easy for
  someone to publish their calendar, allowing other people to check
  their schedule (and, for example, know when our target user has
  classes, when he's planning on studying at a cafe, what nights he's
  thinking of going to a movie, and what concerts he intends on
  seeing). Right now people can do that by publishing .ics files, but
  it's not trivial to do so, and it's work on the part of other people
  to look at them. If it's not HTML hanging off our friend's home page
  that can be viewed in any browser on a public terminal in a library,
  the bar to entry is too high and it's useless.

  <P> Then the next thing you want is an invitation manager like Evite
  but that doesn't suck. Evite sucks because they're spammers, and
  because it's more important to them to put advertising in front of
  your eyeballs than to be useful, so the mail they send out doesn't
  actually include any <I>information</I>, in a lame-assed attempt to
  drive hits to their web site. So what you want next is a free
  replacement for Evite -- but more to the point, one that doesn't
  require any kind of server running anywhere.

  <P> And if it doesn't work with webmail, you've lost before you've
  even begun, so don't do something dumb like requiring a plugin. The
  trick you want to accomplish is that when <I>one</I> person is using
  your software, it suddenly provides value to that person and their
  entire circle of friends, without the friends having had to do
  anything at all. Then, later, you pull the friends into the fold: if
  one of them starts using the software, they become their own hub,
  and get the benefit they have already witnessed from a
  distance. </UL>

<P> And then Nat went back to whichever flyover state Novell is in,
and a few days later he said to me, "wow, you really bummed me out,
because the dozen other people I had talked to before you were all
like, `a free groupware system, that's an awesome idea!' Then you
depressed me, and I came back here and told the other guys what you
had said, and they were all, `Oh, fuck. He's right.'"

<P> Wait, was there a funny part? Ok, maybe not. Nevermind.
