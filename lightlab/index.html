<P> This is a hybrid GTK/OpenGL program for experimenting with the
OpenGL lighting model.  This program lets you set the colors and
positions of three GTK light sources, and watch the effect that has on
a simple 3D scene.  You can select whether the scene contains a
rotating cube, sphere, or teapot, and whether that object has a texture
image on its surface.

<P> Light Lab is not a modeling program; it doesn't even let you save
anything.  But if you're having trouble wrapping your brain around
the various parameters you can set in OpenGL code, you may find it
helpful.

<P> I distribute Light Lab as source code only.  Here it is as a
gzipped tar file:

  <A HREF="https://www.jwz.org/lightlab/lightlab-0.3.tar.gz"><B>lightlab-0.3.tar.gz</B></A>
 </FONT>
</P>

<P> It requires <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20020328054951/http://www.gtk.org:80/">GTK</A> 1.2 or newer, and
an implementation of <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20020326011703/http://opengl.org:80/">OpenGL</A> (such
as <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20020325194525/http://mesa3d.org:80/">Mesa</A>.)

<P> This program was inspired by a like-named GLUT program by Mark
J. Kilgard.  His program allowed one to turn lights on and off, and set
the color of objects as a demo of how lighting works, but did not have
controls to allow one to experiment with specific light positions
colors, which is why I wrote this.

<P> For learning OpenGL programming, I highly recommend Mark's book,
``OpenGL Programming for the X Window System,'' Addison-Wesley 1996,
ISBN 0-201-48359-9.
