DadaDodo is a program that analyses texts for word probabilities, and
then generates random sentences based on that.  Sometimes these sentences are
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19990505083246/http://www.catalog.com:80/hopkins/text/decon.html">nonsense</A>; but 
sometimes they cut right through to the heart of the matter, and reveal
hidden meanings.</B>

<P> William S. <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19980116150226/http://www.thei.aust.com:80/bill/burroughs.html">
Burroughs</A> called this 
``<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19971023160404/http://www.bigtable.com:80/primer/0013b.html">cut up</A> theory.'' 
His approach was to take a page of text, divide it into quadrants, 
rearrange the quadrants, and then read the page across the divisions.
He wrote this way; writing, cutting up, shuffling, 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19971009123632/http://www.bigtable.com:80/">publishing</A> the result.
<A HREF="https://www.jwz.org/webcollage/">Collage</A> and randomness applied to words.  
He saw this as a way of escaping from a prison that words create for us, 
locking us down into one way of thinking: an idea echoed in 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19981203082134/http://www.k-1.com:80/Orwell/">Orwell's</A>
``<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205061248/http://www.k-1.com:80/Orwell/1984.htm">1984</A>,'' where the 
purpose of NewSpeak was to make 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19991127211739/http://www.newspeak.com:80/1984.htm">ThoughtCrime</A> impossible by

<P> In 1976, 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19970813105825/http://www.faqs.org:80/faqs/music/industrial-faq/part1/">
industrial</A> music found a name, when 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19981202110654/http://www.brainwashed.com:80/tg/">Throbbing Gristle</A> formed
Industrial Records (``<I>Industrial Music for Industrial People</I>'') along 
with such bands as <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19990429100032/http://www.brainwashed.com:80/cv/">Cabaret 
Voltaire</A> and <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19971211003631/http://www.sonic-boom.com:80/clockdva/">ClockDVA</A>.
These bands were heavily influenced by Burroughs' ideas, and 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000408235525/http://www.urova.fi:80/home/ttk/media/ihmiset/skuivaka/scrap.htm">cut-up</A>
theory made its way into their music,
when the bands would make tape recordings of found sounds (machinery,
short-wave radio, television newscasts, public conversations) and cut up,
rearrange, and splice the tapes, turning it into music.  

<P> This was long before digital audio: this was done with 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19971022100201/http://arts.ucsc.edu:80/ems/music/equipment/analog_recorders/Analog_Recorders.html#splicing">razor</A>
blades.  Today, it's called 
<A HREF="http://www.cat.pdx.edu/~alf/samples/">sampling</A>, and 
the influence of these bands is felt in nearly all branches of modern
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19980127000553/http://www.cyclesoft.com:80/Audiophile.html">pop</A> music.

<P> This wasn't the first time ``natural'' sounds had been used in musical
compositions; that sort of thing had been going on at least as far back as
the 19th century, and the 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19981205163735/http://pharmdec.wustl.edu:80/juju/surr/surrealism.html">surrealists</A>

Ironically, it was printed with a third of the pages out of order, allegedly
due to a mix-up with the printer: one wonders, however, whether that really

<P> DadaDodo works rather differently than Dissociated Press; whereas
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000817235205/http://www.cs.indiana.edu:80/elisp/xemacs/xemacs_261.html#IDX1640">

DadaDodo tries to work on a larger scale: it scans bodies of text, and builds
a probability tree expressing how frequently word <I>B</I> tends to occur
after word <I>A</I>, and various other statistics; then it generates 
sentences based on those probabilities.

<P> The theory here is that, with a large enough corpus, the generated
sentences will tend to be grammatically correct, but

<P> This kind of 

probability histogram is called a Markov Chain, after Andrei Markov, the
fellow who invented it.  It turns out that Markov Chains can actually be used

<A HREF="https://www.jwz.org/webcollage/">image</A>
processing, for feature recognition; and can be used to analyze 
finite-<WBR>state machines for bottlenecks and critical paths: the states 
which occur most often are where the bottlenecks are.

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B> DadaDodo doesn't work quite as well as I would like
it to. </B><P>

<TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=8 CELLSPACING=8 WIDTH="100%">
<TR><TD WIDTH="33%" VALIGN=TOP BGCOLOR="#EFD0A0"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

<P> Here's the bug: the <I>smaller</I> the amount of input text, the better
the sentences are that it generates.  (Above a certain 
<NOBR>threshold --</NOBR> too low, and you just get the input text back.)

<P> I think I understand why this is.  My guess is that as the body of input
text increases, the probabilities even out to normal-<WBR>english-<WBR>language
distributions, and the end result starts behaving more like picking words at
random in a vacuum.  You don't tend to get sequences of 4, 8, 10 words
together that all make a kind of sense; you get 2, then another 2.  The
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19990508203659/http://www.cs.virginia.edu:80/oracle/">distance</A>
between any two words gets smaller, and the overall probabilities
become obscured.

<P> I don't think treating every pair of words as one ``word'' for statistical
purposes will work very well; that will be too clumpy.

<P> I want some kind of commutative <NOBR>probability --</NOBR> <I>X</I> is
<I>n%</I> likely after <I>A+B</I>, but only <I>m%</I> likely after <I>A+C</I>.
And <I>A+D+E+F+G</I> adds a correspondingly smaller amount of influence.

<P> I'd kind of like to do this without adding another dimension to my graph,
because it's already pretty huge.  Another order of magnitude just won't do.

<P> But it seems that human language isn't a system which can be 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19990508224620/http://www.csse.monash.edu.au:80/other/postmodern.html">modeled</A>
by a Markov chain of length 1.

</FONT>
</TD><TD WIDTH="50%" VALIGN=TOP bgcolor="#C0C090"><FONT COLOR="#000000">

<P> Dissociated press works better because it only ever operates on small
inputs, and always shuffles large-ish chunks.  Burroughs' 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19970703004917/http://www.prominence.com:80/java/poetry/">cut-ups</A> work better
because they work on large-ish chunks, and there are spatial relations that
come into <NOBR>play --</NOBR> even if you shuffle all segments of all pages,
some words on the same segment are still similar distances apart, even if new
words have been interspersed.

<P ALIGN=RIGHT> But I really like the idea of breaking the original text down
into probabilities and then generating from that, rather than taking the
original text and shuffling it.  The shuffling approach feels like it
preserves 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19990203212718/http://rugmd4.chem.rug.nl:80/~hoesel/buzz.cgi">too much</A>
of the original content, whereas all I want to preserve is the original
grammar.  Maybe that's not possible (practical).  </P>

<P> I don't want to have huge lists of nouns/<WBR>verbs.  I don't want to 
encode knowledge of the 
<A HREF="http://www.mcs.net/~jorn/html/ai/racterfaq.html">language</A>
into it.  That way lies intellectually corrupt AI projects which I'll not
taunt by naming here.

<UL>
<P> One possibility would be to keep only the most popular 3-way and higher
combinations around; for the more common ones, I could hold a pointer to
a sub-table, instead of a flat probability.  Their popularity could be
found using a 
<A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/19971013071958/http://hpcc.engin.umich.edu:80/CFD/users/charlton/Thesis/html/node29.html">quadtree</A>-<WBR>style subdivision of the word space (to find the
words that ``clump'' together.)  The problem with this is, it doesn't work
in a streaming fashion; you basically have to have the whole <I>N</I>-way graph
around before you can throw away the less-<WBR>popular combinations, because
you won't know which ones are popular until the end.
</UL>

<P> Another good compression trick would be to quantize the values; though
the maximal numerator or denominator that we need to express the
probabilities might be a 16 bit number (or higher), we probably could make
do with 8 bits (or less) of resolution: have an 8-bit lookup table of
<I>approximate</I> probabilities.  I suspect that the values in this table
would end up being on a logarithmic scale (since that's how nature works.)
