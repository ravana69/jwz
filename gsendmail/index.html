<P> This is a simple standalone mail composition tool for Unix.  It lets
you fill in From, To, CC, and Subject, and compose a text/plain message
in a fixed-width text area with word-wrap.  It does a fair amount of
sanity checking, but other than that, it is frill-free: no HTML, no
attachments, no address book.

<FONT SIZE="+2"><B>The problem:</B></FONT>
<UL>
<P>

        If you install Firefox, or a web-browser-only version of Mozilla
        (that is, not the "Communicator" version, which includes the
        mail reader) then you cannot click on <B>mailto:</B> links in
        web pages.

<P>
        This is, of course, crazy, since <B>mailto:</B> links have been
        supported in all previous web browsers that were not also mail
        readers, including, but not limited to, Netscape 1.0 and NCSA Mosaic.
<P>
        When I learned that they were planning on doing this crazy
        thing, back in like 1997, I tried to talk them out of it, but
        it was no use.  ``Making that work would be too hard,'' they
        said.  Apparently it remained too hard for the next 8+ years.
        It's shit like this that makes me glad to be out of there.

</UL>
<P><FONT SIZE="+2"><B>The Solution:</B></FONT>
<UL>
<P>
        First, get Firefox, or Mozilla 1.6 or newer.  There's no way
        to do this in any older release of Mozilla.

<P>
        Next, install this program, <B>gsendmail.</B>
        Here it is as a gzipped tar file:

        <P><UL>
            <A HREF="https://www.jwz.org/gsendmail/gsendmail-1.3.tar.gz"><B>gsendmail-1.3.tar.gz</B></A>
        </UL>

        <P> It requires <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000520045047/http://www.gnome.org:80/">GNOME</A> 1.0
        and <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20000614223049/http://www.gtk.org:80/">GTK</A> 1.2, or newer.
        Build it like so:

<P><UL><TT><B>
                ./configure<BR>
                make<BR>
                make install<BR>
</B></TT></UL>

        <P> Then you need to tell Mozilla to invoke <B>gsendmail</B> 
        any time a <B>mailto:</B> URL is loaded.  You do this by adding
        a couple of lines to the the <B>user.js</B> file deep under your
        Mozilla directory.  That file may not exist already, but there
        should be a directory with a name something like
        <B>~/.mozilla/default/<I>pm82dm6t</I>.slt/</B> that has a bunch
        of files in it; <B>user.js</B> goes there, and these lines go in
        it:  If you're using Firefox, it will be called
        something like <B>~/.mozilla/firefox/<I>pm82dm6t</I>.default/</B>
        instead.

<P><UL><PRE><B>user_pref("network.protocol-handler.external.mailto", "true");
user_pref("network.protocol-handler.app.mailto", "gsendmail");</B></PRE></UL>

        <P> Restart Mozilla, click on <B>mailto:</B> links, and enjoy!  <P>

        <P> If that doesn't work, then maybe Mozilla is already
        configured to hand mailto: URLs to GNOME, via the
        <B>gnome-moz-remote</B> program.  If mailto: URLs launch 
        <A HREF="https://web.archive.org/web/20040609053731/http://www.novell.com:80/products/evolution/">Evolution</A>,
        that's probably what's going on.  In that case, you need to tell
        GNOME to use <B>gsendmail</B> for mailto: as well.  

        <P> <B>In Gnome 2.2 - 2.6:</B> run <B>gnome-file-types-properties</B>.
        Under <I>"Internet Services",</I> select 
        <I>"Electronic mail transmission",</I> <I>"Edit",</I> and
        replace <I>evolution</I> with <I>gsendmail</I>.  That will
        write the file
        <TT><B>~/.gnome/application-info/user.applications</B></TT>.

        <P> <B>In Gnome 2.8:</B> run
        <B>gnome-default-applications-properties</B>.
        Under <I>"Mail Reader",</I> select 
        <I>"Custom Mail Reader",</I> and type
        <NOBR><I>gsendmail %s</I>.</NOBR>  That will write the data
        into the database under <TT><B>~/.gconf/</B></TT>,
        and you're good to go.

        <P> You can verify the setting by running:
        <NOBR><TT>gconftool-2 -g /desktop/<WBR>gnome/<WBR>url-handlers/<WBR>mailto/<WBR>command</TT></NOBR>

<P>
